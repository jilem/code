The popular nightclub in San Francisco, California. The nightclub is housed in the Native Sons of the Golden West building at 420 Mason Street. Downtown's most glamorous and colossal nightspot led a previous life as an 1890s   Victorian playhouse, and many of the beautiful Art Nouveau trimmings are still   in place. Mission District clubbers won't go near the place -- way too disco and   full of the &quot;bridge and tunnel&quot; crowd -- but for tourists it's a safe bet for a   dance-filled night in the city. The light and sound system here is amazing, and   on weekend nights the huge ballroom floor is packed with sweaty bodies dancing   to thumping DJ beats or live music. When it's time to cool off you can chill on   the mezzanine or fire up in the smoking room. For more information call: 415/693-0777 or visit the <a href="http://www.rubyskye.com">website</a> </p>
